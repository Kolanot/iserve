Test Resources
==============

This folder contains shared resources used for testing the infrastructure. These test resources are a collection of
pre-existing and derived test collections used for evaluating Semantic Web Services infrastructures.
Some of these resources has been generated by other researchers. We do not claim ownership and include them herein
solely for the purposes of testing, research and development.

OWLS-TC3-MSM
============
 Test collection automatically derived from the OWL-S TC3 using the transformer provided by iserve-importer-owls.
 Should changes occur to this transformer, the collection should be updated accordingly to reflect them.
 At the moment only the Turtle version has been generated although other RDF serialisations could be generated.

Jena Geography Dataset (JGD)
============================

Taken from: http://fusion.cs.uni-jena.de/professur/jgd

A dataset of about 200 geography services that have been gathered from web sites like seekda.com, xmethods.com,
webservicelist.com, programmableweb.com, and geonames.org. The dataset has been built for the retrieval of
(semantic) web service technology.

These services have been annotated by ourselves for the purposes of testing the support for discovery.
Annotations are provided for WSDL files using SAWSDL, and for HTML files using hRESTS.

Additionally this module is automatically enriched with 3rd parties' datasets automatically downloaded from the Internet.

OWLS-TC3
========
 Taken from: http://projects.semwebcentral.org/projects/owls-tc/

SAWSDL-TC3-WSDL11
=================
 Taken from: http://projects.semwebcentral.org/projects/sawsdl-tc/

 Third release of the SAWSDL service retrieval test collection named SAWSDL-TC. The collection is intended to support
 the evaluation of the performance of SAWSDL service matchmaking algorithms. SAWSDL-TC has been semi-automatically
 derived from OWLS-TC 4

 Web Service Contest 2008
 ========================
 This module obtains an adapted version of this dataset from: http://iserve.kmi.open.ac.uk/datasets/composit-wsc08.zip

 This version was modified by Pablo Rodriguez Mier (CITIUS - University of Santiago de Compostela). The modified version
 includes the dataset used for evaluating composition engines that exploit semantic descriptions, adapted such that the
 taxonomies provided are captured in OWL.
