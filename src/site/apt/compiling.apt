Compiling iServe

    iServe is largely developed in Java and is entirely managed by Maven both for compilation and testing.
    Below you have a quick reference on how to compile it.

* Requirements

    * Maven 3+
    * An RDF(S) Repository for testing. (Note: Fuseki users should enable 'tdb:unionDefaultGraph true')

* Obtaining the code

+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
 git clone https://github.com/kmi/iserve.git
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

* Create the Configuration File

    Configure iServe by creating the file iserve/iserve-shared-resources/src/main/resources/config.properties.
    In that folder you have a config.properties.reference file that you can use as reference.

    {{{./configuration.html}More information on configuring iServe}}.

* First Time Compilation

    The first time run the entire compilation without execution any tests to ensure everything is compiled and
    installed. Testing takes a bit of time and some tests still depend on the capabilities of the backend
    (e.g., reasoning support), so it is best to first ensure that everything runs fine.

+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
 mvn -DskipTests=true install
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

    Compiling will require having a local installed version of {{{http://kmi.github.io/msm4j/latest}MSM4J}} and {{{https://github.com/kmi/sws-test-collections}SWS-Test-Collections}} (for testing).
    Since we currently do not publish these jars on public registries, you will have to compile and install them manually. We certainly plan to simplify this process but until then, do not fear, it is fairly easy.

* Subsequent Compilations

+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
 mvn clean install
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

    This will run tests as well. In order to run these tests, however, iServe needs to access some files through
    HTTP. Until we automate this you will have to launch a simple Web server locally prior to testing.

    Notably within the sws-test-collections project you should serve the ./src/main/resources/OWLS-TC4_PDDL/htdocs/ folder at port 80.
    Should you have Python installed you can do so easily as follows:

+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
 sudo python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

    This requirement is inherited from the test collections that we use for testing the software unfortunately. We shall be creating our own simpler version that overcomes this issue so that it is easier for developers.

* Generating the Documentation

    The source code of iServe also includes this documentation so you may keep it handy locally. To generate it:

+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
 mvn site:site
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

    To view the resulting documentation:

+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
 mvn site:run
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

    The documentation will be available at {{{http://localhost:10000} http://localhost:10000}}
